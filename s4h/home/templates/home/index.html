                    <p>To say the opioid crisis is an epidemic is an understatement. Over 100,000 people die every year due to overdose; that is why our goal is to improve Narcan accessibility across the United states. Overdose is often a catalyst for the motivation to get clean, but getting clean requires surviving rock bottom.</p>

                    <p>Although this is a major accomplishment, there are still many barriers preventing a significant lowering of overdose deaths. 
                    The two largest barriers in combatting opioid addiction are stigma and financing. Many people are still unwilling to learn about addiction as a disease rather than a character flaw.
                    Through teaching and the sharing of overdose/addiction stories, we hope to help others look at addiction without bias. We hope that combatting the stigma not only helps with financing, but more importantly
                    allows those suffering to feel more comfortable reaching out for help. <br> With this news being so recent, there are currently supply chain and financing issues preventing proper Narcan accessibility. Narcan is inherently expensive 
                    and often not thought of until the time of emergency. While the approval of OTC sale helps reduce the fear of criminal prosecution when treating overdose, most people don't carry enough cash to cover this emergency expense. <br>
                    In overdose seconds matter. The transaction time may be the difference between life and death.
